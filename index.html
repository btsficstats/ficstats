            <p>Hello and welcome (back) to the yearly bangtan ao3 overview!</p>
            <p>For last year's stats, if you want to compare, you can switch the tabs in the header menu or simply click <a href="https://btsficstats.github.io/ficstats/2021">here</a> for the 2021 version.</p>
            <p class="strong">Please note: you can screenshot / cross post whatever you want, but I would love it if you credit me (@btsficdata) or link back to this website somewhere.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Overall</h2>
            <p>In 2022, in total, 35.106 fics were written in the BTS fandom. A lot has happened in the past year, and it's not that surprising that a lot less fic was written compared to previous years! Here’s the overall progress of the total amount of fics.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="totalNumbers" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>Of the 35.106 fics, 24.176 were finished, which is just shy of 69% (nice). Once again congrats to everyone who contributed to this, both writers and readers!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Ships</h2>
            <p>This year's ship stats are not all that surprising if you've been around the BTS ficdom for a while. Taekook still steadily takes the lead, with jikook and yoonmin close behind.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="number2021" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div id="numbercompare" class="chart" style="height: 650px;"></div>
        <div id="numberpie2021" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>Note: the pie chart, while sort of helpful as a visualisation, is inherently a bit flawed as the total of fics here is over 100%. This is because multiple ships can occur on the same fic.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Let's look at relative growth! For the record, you read this chart as “we wrote x% more/less of this ship this year”. Note that this percentage will always look higher on small numbers.</p>
            <p>2seok has known the biggest increase, jumping by almost 10% -- visible in the ship ranking as well, where they jumped up 3 places! The biggest loss goes to vmin, who for the first time ever didn't make the top 6 this year.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="relativegrowth" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>Reducing this data per member (the number of fics where this member is part of the pairing) gives us the next chart.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="member2021" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>The distribution of ot3 fics looks like this: like any other year, maknae line leads the chart by a huge amount, followed by yoonminhope and rapline.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="ot32021" class="chart" style="height: 650px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>
                And for fun, member “harem” fics. Also as usual, the ficdom seems to love everyone loving on the maknae the most.
            </p>
