            <p>Happy new year and welcome to the possibly last time I'll be updating these stats. :)</p>
            <p>For the stats of previous years, if you want to compare, you can switch the tabs in the header menu.</p>
            <p class="strong">Please note: you can screenshot / cross post whatever you want, but I would love it if you credit me (@btsficdata) or link back to this website when you do.</p>

            <h2>Overall</h2>
            <p>In 2023, in total, 28.245 fics were written in the BTS fandom. This brings us back to pre-2018 levels. This is not entirely surprising, but seeing the progress chart is definitely interesting.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="totalNumbers23" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>Of the 28.245 fics, 19.032 were finished, which is about 67.4%. A bit lower than last year, but not by much. Congrats to all writers for contributing!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Ships</h2>
            <p>What's there to say about the ship charts that hasn't been said yet (by me) (many times)? I am convinced Taekook will take the lead of every chart until the end of the world and time and everything.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="number2023" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div id="numbercompare23" class="chart" style="height: 650px;"></div>
        <div id="numberpie2023" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>Note: the pie chart, while sort of helpful as a visualisation, is inherently a bit flawed as the total of fics here is over 100%. This is because multiple ships can occur on the same fic.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p></p>
            <p>Relative growth is a chart I personally have mixed feelings about every year. You read this next chart as “we wrote x% more/less of this ship this year”. This is a percentage that will always look higher on small numbers, so it looks <strong>really</strong> high<strong> on smaller ships while it really only had a small increase or decrease. In short, don't take this one too seriously.</strong>.</p>
            <p></p>

        <div id="relativegrowth23" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>Ship data per member (the number of fics where this member is part of the pairing) gives us the next chart.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="member2023" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>For OT3some pairings, as every year, maknae line takes the lead. For the first time though, there's no rap line in the top three; their spot is bumped by Jin/Namjoon/Jungkook, by three fics.</p>

                I am truly out of things to say about harem fics, but here's the numbers:

            <p>You know the drill: for the next two charts, you can click the chart legend on the right side to show or hide data from the charts. ALT-click will hide everything <i>but</i> the dataset you selected.</p>
            <p>This way, you can see and compare the data YOU want :) Hover for exact data points! Have fun!</p>
