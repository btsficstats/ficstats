            <p>Hello and welcome to the yearly bangtan ao3 overview!</p>
            <p>Yes, I made a website this year. The reason is that I wanted to have interactive charts, instead of just some Google sheets screenshots, I guess? Mostly for readability of the overall charts at the end.</p>
            <p class="strong">Please note: you can screenshot / cross post whatever you want, but I would love it if you credit me (@btsficdata) or link back to this website somewhere :)</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Overall</h2>
            <p>In 2021, in total, 42.915 fics were written in the BTS fandom. For the first time, we have written less fics than last year, when the count was 47.573. Here’s the overall progress of the total amount of fics.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="totalNumbers" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>Of the 42.915 fics, 30.064 were finished, which is just shy of 70% - a record percentage since I’ve started compiling these stats (2017). Great job, writers!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Ships</h2>
            <p>This year’s ship stats look like this. It comes as no surprise that taekook takes the lead once again, followed as usual by jikook and yoonmin. In the tail end, most notably 2seok has made quite a jump up (second to last in 2020) and vmon
                again sinks to the very last.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="number2021" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div id="numbercompare" class="chart" style="height: 650px;"></div>
        <div id="numberpie2021" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>Note: the pie chart, while sort of helpful as a visualisation, is inherently a bit flawed as the total of fics here is over 100%. This is because multiple ships can occur on the same fic.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Biggest relative growth this year goes to taejin! For the record, you read this chart as “we wrote x% more/less of this ship this year”. Note that this percentage will always look higher on small numbers.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="relativegrowth" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>Reducing this data per member (where this member is part of the pairing) gives us the next chart, which isn’t much different than any other year.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="member2021" class="chart" style="height: 520px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>The distribution of ot3 fics looks like this: like any other year, maknae line leads the chart by a huge amount, followed by yoonminhope and rapline.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="ot32021" class="chart" style="height: 650px;"></div>
        <div>
            <p>
                And for fun, member “harem” fics. Also as usual, the ficdom seems to love everyone loving on the maknae the most.
            </p>
